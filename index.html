        <li><h2>Making of Biryani Masala:</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Start your biryani process by making the biryani masala/curry/korma. First wash your chicken properly and set aside in a strainer. On high flame, add oil, ginger garlic paste, and chicken in a large pot. then add shan Bombay biryani mix , kashmiri red chili powder and chicken cube.</p>
        <p>Mix for a minute or two. Now add Whole spices like Cloves, Green Cardamon, Cinnamon sticks and Whole Black Pepper or you can omit or add them according to your availability.</p>
        <p>If your family prefers Biryani with potatoes, add potatoes now (cut into chunks), mix well, add two cups of water, and cook covered for 10-15 minutes on low-medium flame or until the potatoes are near to cooked (70% cooked). Then turn off the flame.</p>
        <li><h2>Parboiling ( partial boiling) of the Rice:</li></h2>
        <p>Meanwhile the chicken is cooking; in another large pot, add water and bring it to boil.</p>
        <p>Once the water boils up, add salt, rice (pre-soaked for 30 minutes) and oil. Cook the rice for 6 minutes or until it gets half cooked (par boiled), it should have a bite. Then strain the rice.</p>
        <p>Don’t let the rice cool off once they are boiled and strained. Use them immediately for steaming (DUM) , make sure your chicken curry is ready before the rice boiling step. Otherwise the rice would begin to curl .</p>
        <li><h2> Layering and Steaming/Dum:</li></h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, the rice is being boiled; in a bowl, add chopped coriander leaves, mint leaves, fried onions, dried plums, stem-off green chilies and thinly sliced tomatoes and toss them all together well.</p>
        <p>Now comes the layering part. Add a layer of all the mixed/tossed ingredients on top of the chicken and increase flame to high. Sprinkle food color (I use Orange-Red), whole spice powder (garam masala), kewra water and biryani essence (optional) on top.</p>
        <p>Now put the final layer of the par-boiled rice. Add half cup of oil on top. Cover the lid and cook on high flame for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Then remove the lid and cook for 5 more minutes on the same high flame. Now turn the flame to lowest and cover the lid properly with foil or cloth for steam (dum) for 5 – 10 minutes.</p>
        <li><h2>How to plate biryani ?</h2></li>
        <p>Once Biryani is ready, its time for plating. Deghi Biryani is not supposed to be mixed up once ready. Instead you have to work your way from bottom of the Degh/Pot to the top. Start plating by taking out masala rice from the bottom. Then subsequently, take out white rice, chicken and potato. Be gentle and try not to break the rice.</p>
        <p>Also, try to use rice serving spoon, professional skimmer spoon or a plate to mix and serve biryani</p>
